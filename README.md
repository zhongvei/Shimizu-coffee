## Introduction 

Coffee being one of the most consumed morning beverage in the world. To most people, it is an essential drink to go with their breakfast. 

In order to get a good cup of coffee, we need professtionally trained barista to get it ready for customer.

Due to this, there is alway a queue to wait for your coffee for the barista to make your drinks even the food is ready. 

By the time we got our drink, the food was cold and did not taste as good as it is hot.

As such, our team was brainstorming if there is any way to shorten the time for the wait of nice cup of coffee and came up with ***SHIMIZU COFFEE*** .


## Concept 

Our solution provides a fully automated coffee machine which can brew the coffee by the requests of users. 

Once the coffee is made, it will be ready for the staff to collect and pack it for the customer. 

Not only this can shortened the waiting time, but also creating less workload for the staff which lead to higher operation efficiency. 


## Design 

As the growing population of ***hand-drip coffee, cold-brew and batch brew coffee***, we decided to use these method as our brewing method in the machine. 

We have also create a mobile interface to allow user to interact with the machine and also provide a potential add-on to exisiting delivery apps for restaurants 

To make the machine more efficient, we have construct a databse for to record the origin, flavour profile and brewing temparture for commonly used coffee beans.
